To get started fork this project on github, or put it on some other service (make it public), and regularly commit the changes you make through the development process.

 There are 3 files to get you started

 1. task_description.md - The description of what you need to do, and what you can do for bonus points. If you have any questions feel free to email me.

 2. environment_setup_guide.md - If you've decided to take on the challenge the instructions on how to set up the environment you'll be working in can be found here.

 3. api_documentation.md - This file gives you a bit more info on the API endpoints, their parameters, and example requests and responses.

 If you have any questions for any of these steps just send an email asking for clarifications.

 Good luck!
